# Arduino Coffee LED Project

This project simulates a coffee machine using LEDs and buttons.  

## How it works
- Each coloured button corresponds to a column of LEDs (yellow, red, blue).
- Pressing a button starts a top-to-bottom LED animation.
- Once finished, the bottom LED stays to signal the "final" coffee
- A potentiometer controls the brightness of the bottom LED.

## Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- 12 LEDs
- 3 buttons
- 1 potentiometer
